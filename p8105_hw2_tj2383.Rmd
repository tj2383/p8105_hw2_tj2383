## Problem 1

Read in and clean the transit dataset:
```{r cleaning}
transit_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", col_types = "cccddcccccccccccccccccccccccddcc") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

According to the cleaning code chunk, this dataset was first imported using the read_csv statement. I then cleaned the variable names so that they were converted to lower case and the snake format, this makes the variables easy to use while coding. I further cleaned the dataset by selecting key variables to include in the dataset; line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, and ada. Lastly, I changed the "entry" variable from a character variable to a logical variable. The dimensions of this dataset are `r dim(transit_data)`. This dataset is still not tidy. For example, there are several "route" variables that could be consolidated.


The following were conducted in this code chunk:
-How many distinct stations are there?
-How many stations are ADA compliant?
-What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
-Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? How many are ADA compliant?
```{r problem1_q}
transit_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) 
select(transit_data, line, station_name, ada) %>% 
  filter(ada == "TRUE") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, ada)
select(transit_data, entry, vending) %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  summarize(mean(entry))
```

According to the problem1_q code chunk, there are `r count(distinct(transit_data, line, station_name))` distinct stations. There are `r count(select(transit_data, line, station_name, ada) %>% 
  filter(ada == "TRUE") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, ada))` ADA compliant stations. The proportion of station entrace/exits with no vending are `r select(transit_data, entry, vending) %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  summarize(mean(entry))`.


In this code chunk reformatted data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. Then I calculated the number of distinct stations serve the A train and how many of them are ADA compliant.
```{r reformat_transit}
reformat_transit_data = 
  transit_data %>% 
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11)

select(reformat_transit_data, route_name, station_name, line) %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)

select(reformat_transit_data, route_name, station_name, line, ada) %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A", ada == "TRUE") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. 17 of these stations are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

Read in and clean the Mr.Trash Wheel dataset
```{r}
trashwheel_data = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% 
  filter(year == "2016") %>% 
  summarize(median(sports_balls))
```

In this code chunk I read in and cleaned 2016 and 2017 Precipitation datasets. For each, I omitted rows without precipitation data and added a variable, `year`. I renamed the variables "precipitation_in" and "x_in". Next, I combined the datasets and converted month to a character variable.
```{r}
precipitation16_data = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", "2016 Precipitation", range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:B")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precipitation_in) & precipitation_in != ("Month")) %>% 
  add_column(year = "2016") %>% 
  rename(month = precipitation_in) %>% 
  rename(rainfall_in = x_1) %>% 
  mutate(rainfall_in = as.numeric(rainfall_in))

precipitation17_data = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", "2017 Precipitation", range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:B")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precipitation_in) & !is.na(x_1) & precipitation_in != ("Month")) %>% 
  add_column(year = "2017") %>% 
  rename(month = precipitation_in) %>% 
  rename(rainfall_in = x_1) %>% 
  mutate(rainfall_in = as.numeric(rainfall_in)) %>% 
  summarize(sum(rainfall_in))

precipitation_16_17_data = bind_rows(precipitation16_data, precipitation17_data) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) 
```

The two original datasets, 2016 Precipitation and 2017 Precipitation were cleaned and combined to make 2016/2017 Precipitation data (precipitation_16_17_data). There are `r nrow(precipitation16_data) ` observations in the 2016 dataset and `r nrow(precipitation17_data) ` observations in the 2017 dataset. The key variables in this dataset include `month` which indicates the month and `rainfall_in` which indicates the rainfall amount in inches. The total precipitation in 2017 was 29.9 inches. The median number of sports balls in 2016 according to the trashwheel_data was 26.

## Problem 3

In this code chunk I read in the data then:
-formatted the data to use appropriate variable names;
focused on the “Overall Health” topic
-excluded variables for class, topic, question, sample size, and everything from lower confidence limit to GeoLocation
-structured data so that values for Response (“Excellent” to “Poor”) are column names / variables which indicate the proportion of subjects with each response (which are values of Data_value in the original dataset)
-created a new variable showing the proportion of responses that were “Excellent” or “Very Good”
```{r}
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -confidence_limit_low:-geo_location) %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(proportion_excellent_verygood = (excellent + very_good) / 100) %>% 
  filter(year == "2002", !is.na(excellent))
```

According to the brfss_dataset there are `r count(distinct(brfss_data, locationdesc))` unique locations. Yes, all states are represented, determined by counting the number of unique states which was `r count(distinct(brfss_data, locationabbr))` including Washington D.C. The state observed the most was . In 2002, the median of the "Excellent" response value was `r brfss_data %>% filter(year == "2002", !is.na(excellent)) %>% 
  summarize(median(excellent))`.
