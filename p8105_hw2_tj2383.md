Problem 1
---------

Read in and clean the transit dataset:

``` r
transit_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", col_types = "cccddcccccccccccccccccccccccddcc") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

According to the cleaning code chunk, this dataset was first imported using the read\_csv statement. I then cleaned the variable names so that they were converted to lower case and the snake format, this makes the variables easy to use while coding. I further cleaned the dataset by selecting key variables to include in the dataset; line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance\_type, and ada. Lastly, I changed the "entry" variable from a character variable to a logical variable. The dimensions of this dataset are 1868, 19. This dataset is still not tidy. For example, there are several "route" variables that could be consolidated.

The following were conducted in this code chunk: -How many distinct stations are there? -How many stations are ADA compliant? -What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance? -Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? How many are ADA compliant?

``` r
transit_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) 
```

``` r
select(transit_data, entry, vending) %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  summarize(mean(entry))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   `mean(entry)`
    ##           <dbl>
    ## 1         0.377

According to the problem1\_q code chunk, there are 465 distinct stations. There are 84 ADA compliant stations. The proportion of station entrace/exits with no vending are 0.3770492.

In this code chunk reformatted data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. Then I calculated the number of distinct stations serve the A train and how many of them are ADA compliant.

``` r
reformat_transit_data = 
  transit_data %>% 
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11)

select(reformat_transit_data, route_name, station_name, line) %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. 17 of these stations are ADA compliant.

Problem 2
---------

Read in and clean the Mr.Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
trashwheel_data = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-3.xlsx", "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
```

In this code chunk I read in and cleaned 2016 and 2017 Precipitation datasets. For each, I omitted rows without precipitation data and added a variable, year. Next, I combined the datasets and converted month to a character variable.

``` r
precipitation16_data = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-3.xlsx", "2016 Precipitation", range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:B")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precipitation_in) & precipitation_in != ("Month")) %>% 
  add_column(year = "2016") 

precipitation17_data = readxl::read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-3.xlsx", "2017 Precipitation", range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:B")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(precipitation_in) & !is.na(x_1) & precipitation_in != ("Month")) %>% 
  add_column(year = "2017") 

precipitation_16_17_data = bind_rows(precipitation16_data, precipitation17_data) %>% 
  mutate(precipitation_in = month.name[as.integer(precipitation_in)]) 
```

The two original datasets, 2016 Precipitation and 2017 Precipitation were cleaned and combined to make 2016/2017 Precipitation data. There are 12 observations in the 2016 dataset and 3 observations in the 2017 dataset. The key variables in this dataset include `precipitation_in` which indicates the month and `x_1` which indicates the rainfall amount. The total precipitation in 2017 was
