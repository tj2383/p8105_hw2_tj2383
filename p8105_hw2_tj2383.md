Problem 1
---------

Read in and clean the transit dataset:

``` r
transit_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, north_south_street, east_west_street, ada) %>% mutate(entry_logical = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset was first imported using the read\_csv statement. I then cleaned the variable names so that they were converted to lower case snake, this makes the variables easy to use while coding. I further cleaned the dataset by selecting key variables to include in the dataset; line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, routes, entry, vending, north-south entrance, east-west entrance, and ADA compliance. Lastly, I changed the "entry" variable from a character variable to a logical variable and called that new variable "entry\_logical". The dimensions of this dataset are 1868, 21. This dataset is not tidy. For example, there are several "route" variables that could be consolidated.
