Problem 1
---------

Read in and clean the transit dataset:

``` r
transit_data = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", col_types = "cccddcccccccccccccccccccccccddcc") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

According to the cleaning code chunk, this dataset was first imported using the read\_csv statement. I then cleaned the variable names so that they were converted to lower case and the snake format, this makes the variables easy to use while coding. I further cleaned the dataset by selecting key variables to include in the dataset; line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance\_type, and ada. Lastly, I changed the "entry" variable from a character variable to a logical variable. The dimensions of this dataset are 1868, 19. This dataset is still not tidy. For example, there are several "route" variables that could be consolidated.

The following were conducted in this code chunk: -How many distinct stations are there? -How many stations are ADA compliant? -What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance? -Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? How many are ADA compliant?

``` r
transit_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) 
```

``` r

  filter(ada == "TRUE") %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, ada)
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 x 3
    ##    line            station_name                   ada

    ## 10 63rd Street     Roosevelt Island               TRUE 
    ## # ... with 74 more rows

``` r
select(transit_data, entry, vending) %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  summarize(mean(entry))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   `mean(entry)`
    ##           <dbl>
    ## 1         0.377

According to the problem1\_q code chunk, there are 465 distinct stations. There are 84 ADA compliant stations. The proportion of station entrace/exits with no vending are 0.3770492.
